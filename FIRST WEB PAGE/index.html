<h1>Mark Cao</h1>

<p>I am a huge fun of the Big Band Theory, and I can recall all the major events that happened in this fantastic American TV show. Although one mystery remains for the director's ignorance, and it's that what is Penny's last name before Hofstadter? Enough about TBT. I also enjoying learning and gaming, which may seem kinda contradictory, but I'd like to call myself "a studious gamer".</p>
<p>Besides, I am also a gamer and I carried my friends countless times in LOL.</p>
